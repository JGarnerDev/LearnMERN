-------------------- More Endpoints --------------------

1. We're going to add more functionality to our exercises routes.

   1a. Open up 'exercises.js' in our routes folder. Add the following code:


    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        newExercise.save()
                    .then(() => res.json('Excercise added!'))
                    .then(err => res.status(400).json('Error: ' + err))
                })

                    router.route('/:id').get((req, res) => {                                    This endpoint has a funky address! '/:id' means
                        Exercise.findById(req.params.id)                                        that it is determined by whatever id the particular
                        .then((exercise) => res.json(exercise))                                 exercise we're trying to access has. This is called
                        .catch(err => res.status(500).json('Error: ' + err))                    'dynamic routing'.
                    })
                                                                                                To explain, say that we have an exercise called "kung-fu" with the id "5099803df3f4948bd2f98391". A routing to 'localhost:5000/exercises/5099803df3f4948bd2f98391' would access this endpoint for the exercise "kung-fu" only.

                                                                                                This particular endpoint is a GET request, retrieving the information of the particular exercise from our directory.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    router.route('/:id').delete((req, res) => {                                 Another dynamic end point! This time, it's a
                        Exercise.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id)                               delete request. Big suprise, it deletes the
                        .then(() => res.json('Exercise deleted'))                               exercise from our directory upon the request.
                        .catch(err => res.status(500).json('Error: ' + err))
                    })

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    router.route('/update/:id').post((req, res) => {                            Another dynamic end point! This one updates our
                        Exercise.findById(req.params.id)                                        'exercise' data with a POST request.
                        .then(exercise => {
                            exercise.username = req.body.username                               To explain, it takes the request made at the
                            exercise.description = req.body.description                         designated '/update/:id' path, makes an 'exercise'
                            exercise.duration = Number(req.body.duration)                       object with the submitted user-defined values,
                            exercise.date = Date(req.body.date)                                 and saves it with the same name and location as
                                                                                                the 'exercise' the user wanted to update. It is superimposed on the previous 'exercise'.
                            exercise.save()
                            .then(() => res.json('Exercise Updated!'))
                            .catch(err => res.status(500).json('Error: ' + err))
                        })
                        .catch(err => res.status(500).json('Error: ' + err))
                    })

    1b. Test our new endpoints with our API testing software (this will be a theme of all back end work)!

        To test our dynamic routing, let's collect an id. Send a GET request to 'http://localhost:5000/exercises' to receive something like...

                                            [
                                            {
                                                "_id": "5dd47deced93883534fa3301",
                                                "username": "beau",
                                                "description": "run",
                                                "duration": 9,
                                                "date": "2019-05-29T02:22:49.052Z",
                                                "createdAt": "2019-11-19T23:42:36.167Z",
                                                "updatedAt": "2019-11-19T23:42:36.167Z",
                                                "__v": 0
                                            }
                                            ]

        Your '_id' will look different than mine! Be sure to copy/paste what you receive rather than the one listed here (for all id related cases)
        Copy that id and add it to the exercises address like so:

                                                http://localhost:5000/exercises/5dd47deced93883534fa3301

        Send the GET request to recieve something like...

                                            {
                                                "_id": "5dd47deced93883534fa3301",
                                                "username": "beau",
                                                "description": "run",
                                                "duration": 9,
                                                "date": "2019-05-29T02:22:49.052Z",
                                                "createdAt": "2019-11-19T23:42:36.167Z",
                                                "updatedAt": "2019-11-19T23:42:36.167Z",
                                                "__v": 0
                                            }

        It worked! It looks exactly the same because the id is associated with the user and exercise simultaneously in the app, but notice how the      first request of section 1b (this section) returned the object nested in an array, while the second request returned an object without      it being nested in an array. This is due to how MongoDB will organize our database.  

        Ok! Two more endpoints to test. Let's do 'router.route('/:id').delete(...)'. Send a DELETE request to:

                                                http://localhost:5000/exercises/5dd47deced93883534fa3301

        It should return with (as we've commanded (coded) it to!)...

                                                "Exercise deleted"

        Huzzah! 

        Now when we send a GET request to 'http://localhost:5000/exercises', we see that it has been removed! Magic. 

        Before we test the last of our 1a endpoints, make sure that there's an exercise there to update in the first place. Using the previous sections, make a new user followed by a new exercise for that user, or add an exercise to a pre-existing user. 


        Having done that, obtain an id of an exercise from 'http://localhost:5000/exercises' for our router.route('/update/:id').post(...).

        Then send a POST request with an exercise object to 'http://localhost:5000/exercises/update/5dd4cc390a655b315881bcaf'. If you ever are unsure what a request object should look like, go ahead and look back to the GET request for 'http://localhost:5000/exercises'. The response is the collection of all exercises. It will look like...

                                            {
                                                "username": "JDAWG",
                                                "description": "kung-fu",
                                                "duration": 10,                                    <------- I changed it from 9 to 10 (I'm sneaky)
                                                "date": "2019-11-19T19:42:19.208Z"
                                            }

        Once sent, we can observe what happens:


            Before (from a GET request to 'http://localhost:5000/exercises'): 

                                            [
                                            {
                                                "_id": "5dd4cc390a655b315881bcaf",
                                                "username": "JDAWG",
                                                "description": "kung-fu",
                                                "duration": 9,                                     <------- Waaaaaait for it... 
                                                "date": "2019-11-19T19:42:19.208Z",
                                                "createdAt": "2019-11-20T05:16:41.426Z",
                                                "updatedAt": "2019-11-20T05:16:41.426Z",
                                                "__v": 0
                                            }
                                            ]

            Our POST request to 'http://localhost:5000/exercises/update/5dd4cc390a655b315881bcaf' (I made a change to "duration"): 

                                            {
                                                "username": "JDAWG",
                                                "description": "kung-fu",
                                                "duration": 10,
                                                "date": "2019-11-19T19:42:19.208Z"
                                            }

            Our response: 

                                                "Exercise Updated!"

            And the resulting change in our database is (from a GET request to 'http://localhost:5000/exercises')...

                                            {
                                                "_id": "5dd4cc390a655b315881bcaf",

                                            }

2. For the purposes of our learning through building this app, we're finished working on our back end! The good news is the next step is super cool     for people that like to make visual material - we're doing front end. The (possibly, and not so bad) bad news is that some aspects of react         resemble doing CRUDoperation routing. For myself, this was bad news, so I've taken the time to understand both the 'how to' and 'why'               (stubbornness wins sometimes!). Furthermore, I'm still and always adhering to Beau Carnes' tutorial video "Learn the MERN Stack - Full Tutorial     (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)" on youtube. He's an amazing teacher that had a huge professional benifit for me. Link and acknowledgement       in the 'README.md' file in the main repository.
