-------------------- React Primer --------------------

1. What is it exactly? 

            React is a "declarative" programming language that allows us to build "components" which derive information from our "state" as brought to us by our "props".

            This is one of the shortest ways to describe React for the purposes of instruction. 

            The official definition from "https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-is-react" is: 
            
                        " React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
                        It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. "

    1a. Right. What's "declarative"? 

        "Declarative" means that we program computations such that we are specifying what we want to be the outcome from them, rather than how we want it done. A passable metaphor for this would be in telling your kids to "go paint the barn red" without saying where or what the resources they need are. This is opposed to spelling it out to your kids as if they had no idea what the world a step away looks like, telling them to "turn 90 degrees left, walk 30 feet, pick up the can of paint...". Such a form of programming language is "imperative". 
        Think of a very hands-on Darth Vader.  

        Since React is declarative, this makes it a HLL (High-Level programming Language). It sounds cool when you say it, but it simply means it uses a higher level of abstraction to do work than a MLL (Mid-Level programming Language) or a LLL (Low-Level programming Language). It's not a literal suggestion of how cool or advanced it is (though some could argue well that it is). To understand what abstraction is in the programming sense is a great but tangential subject matter which I absolutely recommend researching. I'll do my best in brevity:

                Level of abstraction:                       lower                                                          higher
                                                     
                                            let req.body.username = "Barbra Streisand"      |
                                            const username = req.body.username              |            function App() {
                                            return username                                 |                  return (<div>Sup</div>);
                                                                                            |                }
                                                                                            |
                                                                                            |           export default App;

                                            --------------------------------------------                --------------------------------------------


                                            Here username (a variable) is declared                      Here App is defined as a function that      and assigned a value. We then program the                   passes no argument and executes a function
                                            return of that value. Two steps, one value                  that returns something that looks like HTML.
                                            returned.                                                   Then the default(?) of App is exported(?).
                                                                                                       
                                                                                                        It's going to be invoked in another file
                                                                                                        a lot like HTML. Coding <App /> will make
                                                                                                        just about any amount and kind of HTML come out of it when the address gets rendered. Furthermore, <App /> can bring HTML that was made from data that the user had control defining! Instead of a <div> containing the value "Sup", it could be a value defined by user input. It could be a whole video game customized by the user.    

        So more abstraction means roughly that there is more code being done given a single command, and that this amount of code is accountable for retrieving necessary data from outside itself to fulfill its return.

    1b. What are "components"? 

            We use them to tell React what to show on the screen. Each one consists of a JavaScript file and a CSS file which is then imported into a parent component, ultimately leading to the App component. A component's form in JavaScript looks like so: 
                                            

                                                                function App() {
                                                                    return (<div>Sup</div>);}

                                                                export default App;  

                                                                
                                                        

                                                                    or, more accurately, 



                                                                class NavigationBar extends React.Component {
                                                                render() {
                                                                    return (
                                                                        <div className="NavigationBar">
                                                                            <Search { results: "" }/>
                                                                            <Home />
                                                                            <ContactUs { location: userlocation }/>
                                                                        </div>
                                                                    )
                                                                }
                                                                }

                                                                export default NavigationBar

    1c. What are "props"?

        "Properties". Parameters that the React coponents use in constructing visual material within the DOM. Properties are inherited from values outside the compontent. A username typed out by a client, the time of day - anything dynamic.
