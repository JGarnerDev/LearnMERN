-------------------- Building the Foundation --------------------

1. Go ahead and type in 'create-react-app' to your console followed by " " and the name of your app and press enter. You can call it "poop" if you      like. If you try calling it "best poop", jokes on you - it will ignore what is after the space proceeding "best" and your app will be called        "best". "best-poop" will work and demonstrates common practice naming methods (not the content, however). 

                                    Ex:    create-react-app best-poop

    Furthermore, if you're unfamiliar with navigating directories (i.e. you just typed in 'create-react-app best-poop' but your app is in the wrong folder), you can close your code editor and move the file now with your computer operating system. In the future, when you want to make something by running console commands, look to the left of what your typing and it will state the directory you're doing stuff in. 

                    PS C:\Users\****\Desktop\Coding\Exercises\React Big Concepts>

                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                            The current directory!

    To change your current directory, you must use the 'cd' command. By the time you type 'cd ./', you can press tab and it will cycle through and write out the folders that are in the current directory.

                    PS C:\Users\****\Desktop\Coding>                           cd ./iDoMyProjectsHere

                                    vvvvvvvvv

                    PS C:\Users\****\Desktop\Coding\iDoMyProjectsHere>  

    This gets you into nested directories (folders deeper within folders). To move back a step, it would look like 'cd ../' 

                    PS C:\Users\****\Desktop\Coding>                           cd ../

                                    vvvvvvvvv

                    PS C:\Users\****\Desktop>

    To see a list of directories in the current directory, input 'ls'


2. Make a backend folder in the main folder. cd to it. 

    2a. 'npm init -y'                                            to make a package.json 

    2b. 'npm install express cors mongoose dotenv'               The packages:

                                                                    - Express: Lightweight, fast web framework for Node.js

                                                                    - Cors: 'Cross-Origin Resource Sharing', allows AJAX requests to skip 
                                                                        the 'same origin' policy and access resources from remote sources.
                                                                        Express middleware.

                                                                    - Mongoose: Makes the access of MongoDB via Node.js simpler.

                                                                    - dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file into a   
                                                                        process.env file. Simplifies development by storing environment variables 
                                                                        on a file instead of in our development machine
                                                                        
    2c. 'npm install -g nodemon'                                A global install of nodemon

                                                                    - makes development easier for Node.js applications by automatically        
                                                                        restarting the node application while file changes in the directory
                                                                        are detected.   

3. Create the server

    3a. Create a 'server.js' file in the backend folder. Let's start with this code: 

    vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
               
                const express = require('express')                             Accessing our technologies (Framework, middleware)                                       
                const cors = require('cors')                                        
                const mongoose = require('mongoose')                          
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                require('dotenv').config()                                     Configures our environment variables into a .env file        
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                const app = express()                                          Builds our Express server         
                const port = process.env.PORT || 5000                          ...onto this port (5000)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                app.use(cors())                                                Middleware: cors, and a general JSON parser
                app.use(express.json())                                  
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                app.listen(port, () => {                                       This starts the server
                    console.log(`server is running on port: ${port}`);      
                })                                                          

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    3b. Establishing a connection to our database.

        In server.js, place this code between our app.use() and app.listen() methods

                //

                app.use(cors())
                app.use(express.json())     

    vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
                const uri = process.env.ATLAS_URI                                           Our database URI, or the adress where it is stored.

                                                                                            We will need to set 'ATLAS_URI' 

                mongoose.connect(uri, {useNewUrlParser: true, useCreateIndex: true }        'useNewUrlParser: true' for Node.js to parse Mongo 
                    )                                                                        strings

                const connection = mongoose.connection                                      'useCreateIndex: true' for MongoDB's index function


                connection.once('open', () => {                                             Just a nice 'howdy-doo' from your MongoDB connection 
                    console.log("MongoDB database connection established succesfully");     to know it happened  
                })
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                app.listen(port, () => {                                      
                    console.log(`server is running on port: ${port}`);      
                })     

                //

        Now we need to set 'ATLAS_URI'

        Make a .env file in your backend folder. Literally name it '.env' (no prefix)

            The following code goes in the '.env' file:
    
    vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

            ATLAS_URI = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0-iydrs.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Replace '<username>' and '<password>' with the username and password established for your admin in your cluster's 
        Database Access section on 'mongodb.com'.

        Input 'nodemon server' to the console to see if everything works. Your console will tell you (because you told it to!)!

        Yay connection!
