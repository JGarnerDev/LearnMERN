-------------------- This Lesson --------------------     

    Apps are built with a stack - a collection of frameworks, databases, libraries, and drivers that make development and implementation possible   and easier. A professional web developer must know what these technologies do and how they work in a general and practical sense. It is         effectively the boundary between being a student and being a practitioner, as building an app is a necessary and lucrative for businesses       in the modern economy. Make an app, put it in your portfolio, get the job. 

    'MERN' is an abbreviation for the foundational tools we will use to develop our app. It's our 'stack'. 

                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
                            (M) MongoDB - A document based open source database 
                            (E) Express - A web aplication framework for Node.js (webserver)
                            (R) React   - A JavaScript front-end library for building user interfaces
                            (N) Node.js - A JavaScript run-time environment (driver) that executes JavaScript outside of a browser (like a server)

                            (*) Mongoose - A schema-based solution to model application data

                            *Mongoose is necessary for this lesson but not for MERN development. It's a tool that will make our lives easier.

    There are many stacks, and each company and developer has their preference. Their differences yield different methodoligies, terminologies, benefits, and shortcomings. 

    MERN has the pleasant advantage to we the developers as being quite popular. We gain much by learning it as our first stack or our latest stack. As for its computational merits relative to others, I'm not wordly enough to say as of yet. 

    This will be an exercise app. It's core functionalities will allow for users to record a singular exercise regiment that they are doing.

    The lesson will result in a fully functional app (both front end and back end will be functional), but we won't go over styling much here. What we cover here is necessary and unembellished. 
    
    We will cover:

        Front End

            Displaying information (through React)

                - Components (structures of HTML and CSS that are dynamic and can be easily placed anywhere in our app)
                - State (An object that harbors user data for us to dynamically present our app according to their data)
                - Props (The means of conveying data from our state to components)

        Back End

            Communicating information (through MongoDB, Express, and Node.js)

                - Server (that which coordinates how all data is moved based upon the url and app functionality)
                - Routes (extensions of the server that manage specific data based on paths)
                - Database (the filing cabinet that stores our data remotely)
                - Models (the organizing structures we will apply to our data)
